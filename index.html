  <h2>Challenges Faced by Today’s Students</h2>
  


  <p>
    Many students struggle after completing 10th or 12th due to a lack of proper guidance
    and reliable resources. Career confusion is one of the most common challenges, as
    students often feel unsure about which stream, domain, or career path truly matches
    their interests and strengths. Even after selecting a field, the absence of proper
    learning roadmaps creates uncertainty about what skills to learn, the correct order
    to follow, and the best platforms to rely on.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another major issue students face is resume building. Without prior experience,
    many students find it difficult to create a professional resume or understand what
    information recruiters actually look for. Along with this, learning resources related
    to skills, projects, and career preparation are scattered across multiple platforms,
    making the learning process overwhelming and unfocused.
  </p>

  <p>
    Most importantly, students lack early-stage mentorship and career guidance. Without
    access to mentors or counselors at the right time, students often make decisions
    based on confusion, peer pressure, or incomplete information, which affects their
    long-term career growth.
